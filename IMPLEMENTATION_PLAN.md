## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Email deliverability problems**
   - Solution: Implement multiple email providers with fallback
2. **Social auth token expiration**
   - Solution: Implement automatic token refresh
3. **Database migration failures**
   - Solution: Create backup and rollback procedures
4. **Performance issues with high user load**
