# Social Auth Service Fixes - Progress Tracking

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Fixed Facebook Authentication Token Property
- **File**: `trendy/lib/services/social_auth_service.dart`
- **Issue**: The `AccessToken` property name was incorrect
- **Fix**: Changed from `accessToken.accessToken` to `accessToken.toString()`
- **Lines Updated**: 
  - Line 58: `accessToken.toString()` for Firebase credential
  - Line 76: `accessToken.toString()` for backend API call

### ✅ Added Logger Package
- **File**: `trendy/pubspec.yaml`
- **Change**: Added `logger: ^1.0.0` to dependencies
- **Purpose**: Replace `print` statements with proper logging

### ✅ Replaced Print Statements with Logger
- **File**: `trendy/lib/services/social_auth_service.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `package:logger/logger.dart`
  - Added `final Logger _logger = Logger();` instance
  - Replaced all `print` statements with `_logger.e()` for error logging
  - Lines updated: 42, 84, 126

### ✅ Code Analysis
- **Status**: Dart analysis completed successfully - **No issues found!**
- **Previous Warnings**: All 3 warnings about using `print` statements have been resolved

## Current Status

The Facebook authentication should now work correctly with the updated token property access. The `toString()` method should provide the correct token string for both Firebase authentication and backend API registration.

All code quality issues have been resolved by replacing `print` statements with proper logging using the `logger` package.

## Files Modified

- `trendy/pubspec.yaml` - Added logger package dependency
- `trendy/lib/services/social_auth_service.dart` - Fixed Facebook token property access and replaced print statements with logger
